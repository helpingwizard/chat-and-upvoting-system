## Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages in real-time using WebSockets.
- **Upvoting**: Users can upvote messages, promoting the most relevant or popular messages in a chat.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The system is designed using OOP principles, making it modular and easy to extend.
- **In-Memory Data Storage**: The chat data is stored in memory for fast access and simplicity.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **WebSockets**: Protocol for real-time communication.
